# Who Are Your Characters?

A good place to start, in the novel writing process, is to identify your characters.

* Who is the protagonist in the story?

    The protagonist in a novel is the main character who drives the action and whose fate matters most. The protagonist is often the hero or heroine, but not always an upstanding moral citizen. The term “protagonist” comes from the Greek word “protagonistes”, meaning “first combatant”. The protagonist is the lens through which the reader sees the story unfold. 

* Who is the antagonist?

    The antagonist in a novel is usually a character who opposes the protagonist (or main character) of a story, but the antagonist can also be a group of characters, an institution, or some force against which the protagonist must contend. The antagonist creates conflicts, obstacles, or situations that make the story more dramatic or comedic. In many cases, the antagonist is the most colorful and interesting character in a novel. Think "The Judge" in *Blood Meridian*.

## Build Your Characters' Stories

Every character who appears in a story should have a purpose for being there. There must be something about who they are and what motivates them for them to be a part of your story, and to understand those complex human issues you need to spend time with your characters. Create back stories for them. Give them personalities, traits, quirks, characteristics. How do they dress, talk, walk and behave. Who do they love, who do they hate, what do they relate to?
