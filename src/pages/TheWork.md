# Now - The Work

You can plan, plot, and think forever, but none of it means a thing until you get your ideas down on...whatever it is we get thoughts down on in these times.

## Daily Writing

You have to write every day, and if you don't want to you aren't cut out for this line of work.

## Obstacles

There is no such thing as writer's block, only writer's who don't really want to write, perhaps at the moment, perhaps not at all.

## The Publishing Business

That no longer exists, but reference sake, there was a time when writer's sought out publishers, then a time when writer's sought out agents who sought out publishers, and now all the publishing companies have failed, so that entire landscape has evolved into a KDP world.
